**SPMX** lists Swift packages that reside on GitHub. 
It allows software developers to easily find and explore Swift packages for use in their iOS and macOs Apps. 

![overview2](images/shot3.png)

The **SPMX** App relies on the list of Swift packages from 
[Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/). It is in essence an interface to this list.

To use **SPMX** you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). In your account you also need to setup a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). Use this token to login to **SPMX**.

**SPMX** requires ios 14 or macos 11.

**SPMX** tries to gather some information from the **Package.swift** file. 
When this file is too complex, the relevant package information may show **?**.

Note that the Swift versions displayed, comes from the *swiftLanguageVersions* method in **Package.swift**. If not present, the Swift tools version is displayed instead.

**SPMX** includes a search for keywords option. Use a set of space separated words to search **github** for swift packages. Packages that contains the selected keywords in their description or README.md file are retrieved. The maximum number of packages to search for, is set in the **Settings** (the gear shape icon). Large numbers take longer to process.
