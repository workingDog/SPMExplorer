<p><strong>SPMX</strong> lists Swift packages that reside on GitHub. 
It allows software developers to easily find and explore Swift packages for use in their iOS and macOs Apps.
</p>

<p><img src="/SPMExplorer/images/shot3.png" alt="overview2" /></p>

<p><strong>SPMX</strong> Apps rely on the list of Swift packages from <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/">Swift Package Index</a>. It is in essence an interface to this list.</p>

<p>To use <strong>SPMX</strong> you need a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account.</a> In your account you also need to setup a  <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">Personal Access Token</a>. Use this token to login to <strong>SPMX.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>SPMX</strong> requires iOS 14.2 or macOS 11.</p>

<p><strong>SPMX</strong> tries to gather some information from the <strong>Package.swift</strong> file. 
When this file is too complex, the relevant package information may show <strong>?</strong>.</p>

<p>Note that the Swift versions displayed, comes from the swiftLanguageVersions method in <strong>Package.swift</strong>. 
If not present, the Swift tools version is displayed instead.</p>

<p><strong>SPMX</strong> includes a search for keywords option. Use a set of space 
separated words to search <strong>github</strong> for swift packages. 
Packages that contains the selected keywords in their description or README.md file are retrieved. 
The maximum number of packages to search for, is set in the <strong>Settings</strong> (the gear shape icon). 
Large numbers take longer to process.</p>
